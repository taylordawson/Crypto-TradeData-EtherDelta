# Crypto-TradeData-EtherDelta
This program was to test the feasibility to pull live crypto currency market data from various exchanges in the early stages of them creating Websocket/Rest API connections. Some of the exchanges tested were GDAX, Poloniex, Liqui, etc.. 

There are two scripts which can be run, one sets up the websocket connections to gather the market data, the other will populate the database with the stored data for use in trading. See the scripts for details. Set up a database and a config file with the database parameters that will be read to connect to the database. 

This currently is not being actively developed, please reach out if you want further information/udates to the code. This was very quickly written and could be vastly improved if required.
